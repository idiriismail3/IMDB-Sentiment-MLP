IMDB Movie Reviews Sentiment Classification


Project Overview:

This project implements a sentiment classifier for IMDB movie reviews using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. The objective is to predict whether a review is positive (1) or negative (0).

Feature Engineering:

Two sentiment lexicon-based features were extracted from each review:

1. VADER compound polarity score
2. TextBlob polarity score

Both features range from -1 (negative sentiment) to +1 (positive sentiment).
These two numerical features form the input vector to the neural network.

Model Architecture:

The classifier is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with the following structure:

- Input layer: 2 features (VADER, TextBlob)
- Hidden Layer 1: 16 neurons, ReLU activation
- Hidden Layer 2: 8 neurons, ReLU activation
- Output Layer: 1 neuron, Sigmoid activation

Training Configuration:

- Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy
- Optimizer: Adam
- Batch Size: 32
- Epochs: 10
- Train/Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing
- Random State: 42

Model Performance:

The model was evaluated on 10,000 test samples.

Confusion Matrix Results:
- True Negatives (TN): 3980
- False Positives (FP): 981
- False Negatives (FN): 1310
- True Positives (TP): 3729

Test Accuracy:
77.09%

Interpretation:

The model correctly classifies most negative and positive reviews.
However, there are still misclassifications:

- 981 negative reviews were incorrectly predicted as positive.
- 1310 positive reviews were incorrectly predicted as negative.

The accuracy curve shows stable convergence around 77% on both training
and validation sets, indicating that the model is not heavily overfitting.

Since only lexicon-based polarity features were used (without TF-IDF,
word embeddings, or deep text representations), the achieved performance
reflects the predictive power of simple sentiment scores.

Conclusion:

This project demonstrates that combining VADER and TextBlob polarity
scores with a Multi-Layer Perceptron can achieve solid performance
(77.09% accuracy) on sentiment classification. More advanced feature
representations could further improve performance.
